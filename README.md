I am Pascal ADECHINAN student in third year of computer security at the University of Abomey Calavi and Data scientist in apprenticeship. Author on programming in python and artificial intelligence.


In a business the customer churn rate is very crucial because the cost of retaining an existing customer is much lower than that of acquiring a new one. A customer's churn occurs when the customer decides to stop using a company's services, content, or products. There are many examples and cases of unsubscribing:
- Cancellation of a contracted service or not;
- Purchase from another competing store;
- Unsubscribe from a newsletter;
- Closing of bank account;
- etc...

In this business world where a company faces many competitors, the cost of acquiring new customers is very high. Therefore, the loyalty of existing customers is more important for companies. Thus, the company must better understand the behavior of its customers, in order to retain them. One way to do this is to create a Machine Learning or Artificial Neural Network model that can predict which customers are likely to unsubscribe. The company can thus better target and retain these specific customers who present a higher risk of unsubscription.

In this project we explored a dataset from a telecommunications company and created a model to predict customers with a higher risk of churn. We used different Machine Learning algorithms to compare their performance and then we chose the best model.
